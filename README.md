# X line Overlays for RTSS
Just some of my custom RTSS overlays, inspired originally by Steam Deck's performance overlay.

Made in mind with `Afterburner + RTSS combination` as that's what I personally use, may or may not work properly on its own.

**To load the overlay**, go to RTSS - Setup - Plugins - tick **OverlayEditor** then double click it to open the Editor
After opening the Editor, go to top left corner - Layouts - Load and that's it. 

If you have double overlays, then disable the one from Afterburner by going to Afterburner settings - Monitoring and disabling all the enabled "show in OSD" values.

Protip - you can create a profile on Afterburner just for the monitoring settings if you ever want to switch back to it. Go to AB Settings - Profiles - turn on (just) Monitoring settings and save a profile with enabled AB values and without so you can easily switch.

You can also use the **HotkeyEditor** in RTSS to switch between multiple custom overlays.

## Previews
`API` - the API will match the colour of the CPU or GPU layer to indicate the bottleneck instead of being a separate layer

`nomode` - removed PresentMode layer
